# VSD-RTL-Design-and-Synthesis
The semiconductor industry is undergoing a major shift towards open-source toolchains and PDKs like SKY130 for chip prototyping and tapeout.  This workshop empowers you to master Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, simulation, and synthesis using industry-aligned open-source tools.

This repository contains material from an RTL design workshop focusing on Verilog and the SKY130 open-source technology. The objective of the program is to develop a strong understanding of writing reliable RTL code that behaves consistently when implemented in silicon. The flow covers several key areas, including creating Verilog designs that follow proper coding practices, verifying functionality through functional simulation, building testbenches to check design correctness, performing logic synthesis, and finally running gate-level simulations on the synthesised netlist to ensure the design works as expected after synthesis.

# About This Workshop
Workshops provide a structured environment where learning, experimentation, and collaboration intersect. They help individuals of all experience levels — from beginners to professionals — to develop essential practical skills, understand emerging technologies, and connect with a like-minded community. The broader goals include enhancing creativity, boosting confidence, and equipping participants with knowledge that extends beyond traditional classroom or work settings.

# Prerequisites
 
> Basic understanding of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, etc.)

> Familiarity with Linux shell commands

> A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)

   Tools:  git, iverilog, gtkwave, yosys, and a text editor
